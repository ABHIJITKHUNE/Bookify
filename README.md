# Introduction to Create React App

This project was initialized with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Commands at Your Disposal

In the project directory, you have the following commands:

### `npm start`

Launches the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in your browser.

The page will automatically refresh when changes are made.\
Lint errors, if any, will be visible in the console.

### `npm test`

Activates the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
Refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more details.

### `npm run build`

Compiles the app for production in the `build` folder.\
It appropriately bundles React in production mode and optimizes for performance.

The build includes minification, and file names incorporate hashes.\
Your app is now ready for deployment!

Refer to the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section for additional information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you're dissatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can always `eject`. This action removes the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project for full control. All commands except `eject` will continue to work, but they will point to the copied scripts, allowing you to customize them. At this point, you're on your own.

Using `eject` is optional. The provided feature set is suitable for small to medium deployments, and you're not obligated to use this feature. However, it's available for customization when needed.
